# overlapping-polygon
To calculate the overlapping area of all the polygons. Something like an intersection of all the given polygons.

NOTE : Some modifications are needed to sort the points of convex polygon in anticlockwise order. Will work on them. (Instead of sorting the points based on the center sort the points using graham scan).
